# Neos-Scratch-Game-Tasser
A simple utility to TAS (Tool Assisst Speedrun) ANY Scratch Game.
Built with Turbowarp, I'm trying to make it work in vanilla scratch, but we will see.

Note: This is a concept, and is the process of being built. Don't expect it to be published any time soon, it's very difficult to build this lol.

# Idea for how it will work

The idea is that it will all work in a single sprite. You can export the sprite, and import it into a game.
Think of it like a "plugin". It doesn't modify the game, it just saves inputs.
What will be tricky is working out how to get it to pause the game on inputs and/or play the game slower. I've thought about lagging the game so much that it slows it down, but this system is a bit complicated and depending on what computer you have, will give you a varied FPS. The other way is just to build it in Turbowarp and manually modify runtime settings, but that would mean no vanilla scratch stuff. So... yeah. It might involve copying a bit of code into the game's vanilla code, not just adding a sprite. Again, we will see ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
